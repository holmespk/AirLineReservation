# AirLineReservation
This programming project involves developing a Airline Reservation System for use by travel professionals (i.e. not passengers). It should be a Java-based GUI application that
interfaces with a backend MySQL database to manage its data 1 . Your GUI may be either a native application or browser-based (e.g JSP, ASP).
Your database schema should be based on Figure 3.8 (page 82) in your textbook. A description of the high-level functionality can be found in Exercise 3.12 (page 81). An
ER diagram can be found in Figure 7.20 (page 236), which provides a conceptual model. You must provide a GUI interface of your own design to implement the required Use
Cases. You do not have to provide a GUI interface for importing bulk data sets. You may assume that this task can be done by a DBA via the command line. You will be
provided with a data set for grading.

Use Cases
